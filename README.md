# Session-based-modeling
In this repo, we work on session-based modeling by simple kNN methods and deep learning models. In stage 1, we focus on kNN methods and then go for deep learning (DL) models that are already proposed in the literature. Finally, we conduct a fair comparison among simple and DL models by using the same top@K recommendations and performance measures. So, as we know that DL models have achieved tremendous performance, especially in natural language processing and computer vision fields. So, the aim is to evaluate the fair contribution of these models in the recommendation area.
